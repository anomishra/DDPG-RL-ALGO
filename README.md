This implementation is inspired from tflearn example of titanic dataset. I modified the implementation into simple pandas dataframe of manipulating the dataset required to feed into neural network.

tflearn link: http://tflearn.org/tutorials/quickstart.html

Dependency and platforms:

1. Implemented in Google Colab
2. Python 3.6
3. tflearn
4. tensorflow
5. pandas
7. seaborn
6. sklearn (optional)
7. Dataset - Titanic data from tflearn datasets
